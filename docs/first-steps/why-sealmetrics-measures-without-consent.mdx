# Why SealMetrics Can Measure Without Consent

The question we’re asked most often is:  
**“Why can SealMetrics measure without user consent?”**

The answer is simple — and 100% compliant.

---

## Full Legal Compliance

SealMetrics operates **fully within current privacy regulations** and adheres to the strictest guidelines set by both:

- 🇪🇸 **AEPD** (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos)  
- 🇫🇷 **CNIL** (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés)

These organizations explicitly recognize that **aggregated, non-identifiable measurement systems** can operate **without requiring user consent**.

SealMetrics follows these principles rigorously and undergoes continuous legal and technical reviews to maintain compliance.

---

## Cookieless and Consentless by Design

**SealMetrics is a 100% cookieless tracking system.**

Our technology collects only **aggregated, non-personal data**, ensuring that **no individual user can ever be identified**.  
SealMetrics measures "hits" — not users, sessions, or journeys.

Each interaction is treated as an **independent event**, making it technically and legally impossible to connect actions to a single user.

---

## What SealMetrics Tracks

For each hit (or page view), SealMetrics records only four variables:

- **Timestamp** — When the event occurred  
- **User Agent** — Used temporarily for aggregation, never stored  
- **Current URL** — The page where the event happened  
- **Referral URL** — Where the visitor came from

That’s it — no cookies, no IP addresses, no device IDs, and no fingerprinting.

---

## In Line with ePrivacy and GDPR

According to the **ePrivacy Regulation**, if you wish to **track users individually** — even anonymously — **you must obtain consent**.

SealMetrics doesn’t track users.  
We measure **isolated page views ("hits")**, not behavioral journeys.  
This ensures full compliance with:

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**  
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**  
- **PECR (UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations)**  
- **ePrivacy Directive**

---

## Why This Matters

SealMetrics provides marketers and analysts with **accurate, consentless insights** —  
ensuring **100% traffic measurement** without violating user privacy.

> By design, SealMetrics can’t track individuals — and that’s exactly why it doesn’t need consent.

This approach guarantees a **sustainable, privacy-first future for analytics**, built on trust, transparency, and compliance.
