# How SealMetrics Calculates Entrances

Understanding how Entrances work is essential for interpreting your traffic accurately in a privacy-first environment. SealMetrics uses a simple, transparent method that complies with GDPR and ePrivacy while still providing actionable insights.

## What Is an Entrance?

An **Entrance** represents an access to your website.  
Every time a user lands on your site, SealMetrics records a new Entrance — regardless of whether the user has visited recently.

### Example  
If the same user visits your website **5 times in 10 minutes**, SealMetrics records:

**➡️ 5 Entrances**

Why?  
Because SealMetrics does **not** track individuals, sessions, or returning users.  
Each access is counted independently to ensure full privacy compliance.

## Entrances vs. Visits (GA4)

| Metric | How It Works | Requires Consent? | Why |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Visits (GA4)** | Groups interactions into a *session* based on timing and user identity | ✔️ Yes | GA4 needs to identify the user to determine session boundaries |
| **Entrances (SealMetrics)** | Counts each access as a separate event | ❌ No | No user identifiers, no session stitching |

### Key Difference  
GA4’s “Visit” is a **user-based** metric.  
SealMetrics’ “Entrance” is an **event-based** metric.

SealMetrics never identifies or reconstructs individual users, so each access is counted as its own independent Entrance.

## Entrances vs. Pageviews in SealMetrics

SealMetrics records all interactions as **hits**, then categorizes them based on their context.

### Hit Types in SealMetrics

#### **1. Microconversions / Conversions**
A hit becomes a conversion when it has a defined name, such as:

- `add-to-cart`
- `purchase`
- `lead`
- `signup`

#### **2. Pageviews**
A hit is a pageview when:

- The hit’s domain **matches** the referrer domain  
  (meaning the user navigated within the same site)

#### **3. Entrances**
A hit is an Entrance when:

- The referrer **does not match** the tracked domain  
  (meaning the user arrived from outside your site)

### Summary Table

| Scenario | Classification |
|---------|----------------|
| User lands from Google | **Entrance** |
| User clicks to another page internally | **Pageview** |
| User completes a conversion event | **Conversion / Microconversion** |

## Why Entrances Matter

Entrances give you:

- A **privacy-safe measurement** of how often people access your website  
- A method that requires **no cookies, no identifiers, no consent**
- A consistent way to track traffic across all browsers and privacy restrictions

Even if the same person enters multiple times from SEO, each access is counted independently.  
This is intentional — it’s how SealMetrics remains fully compliant while still providing meaningful traffic volume insights.

## Conclusion

SealMetrics simplifies traffic measurement with a privacy-first, event-based approach:

- **Entrances** count how many times your website is accessed  
- **Pagesviews** reflect internal navigation  
- **Conversions** represent meaningful actions

While Entrances are not equivalent to “sessions” or “unique visitors,” they provide a reliable, compliant way to understand traffic volumes in a cookieless world.

This method ensures:

✔ No user tracking  
✔ No identifiers  
✔ No consent required  
✔ Accurate, transparent traffic measurement  

SealMetrics delivers analytics designed for the privacy-first era — without compromising data integrity.
