# Consentless Analytics FAQ

## How can SealMetrics measure without consent?

SealMetrics complies 100 percent with ePrivacy, GDPR, CCPA, and PECR.  
We follow the measurement guidelines established by the AEPD and CNIL.

SealMetrics is a cookieless tracking system.  
No cookies, no fingerprinting, no cross-session tracking, no personal data.

We only track isolated hits (page views), not user journeys.

---

## Do you track users anonymously?

No.  
We do not track users individually, even anonymously.

Every interaction is treated as a standalone hit.  
There is no reconstruction of journeys, no profiling, no identification.

---

## What makes SealMetrics compliant?

For each hit, SealMetrics records:

- Timestamp  
- URL  
- Referral URL  
- User Agent (not stored permanently)

No IP address  
No persistent identifiers  
No device fingerprinting  

This ensures full compliance with all privacy regulations.

## Why does consentless analytics require aggregated measurement?

Because ePrivacy requires consent for any technology that tracks users across sessions.  
SealMetrics avoids this entirely by **not linking hits**, making it inherently compliant.
