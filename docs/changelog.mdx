## Breaking Changes & Updates

### 🔄 Facebook Ads Attribution Update

:::warning Breaking Change
As of this release, the `fbclid` parameter is no longer used to identify Facebook Ads traffic due to its lack of reliability and consistency.
:::

**What this means for you:**

- Facebook Ads traffic now **requires properly configured UTM tags** for accurate attribution
- Ensure your campaigns include the parameters: `utm_source=facebook`, `utm_medium=paid` (or similar)
- This improvement ensures more accurate attribution and full control over your data

**Recommendation:** Review and update your Facebook Ads campaigns with appropriate UTMs to maintain complete visibility of your traffic.

2. **Add UTM parameters:** Configure UTMs in your Facebook Ads Manager
3. **Test:** Verify that traffic is being properly attributed in Sealmetrics
4. **Monitor:** Check your reports to ensure continuity in your data
