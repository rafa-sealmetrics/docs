# Integrations

Sealmetrics fits seamlessly into your existing workflow. Whether you're running a simple website or a complex web application, integration takes minutes—not hours.

## Direct Integration Methods

### Manual Script Installation

The fastest way to start tracking. Add one script tag to your website's `<head>` section and you're done.

**Setup time:** 2 minutes

**Perfect for:**
- Static HTML websites
- Custom-built applications
- Direct control over your codebase
- Developers who prefer manual implementation

Simply copy your unique tracking code from the Sealmetrics dashboard and paste it into your site's header. Start seeing data immediately.

### Google Tag Manager

Deploy Sealmetrics through Google Tag Manager for centralized tag management and easy configuration updates.

**Setup time:** 5 minutes

**Perfect for:**
- Marketing teams managing multiple tags
- Organizations using GTM for tag governance
- Sites that need frequent tracking updates
- Teams that want non-developer configuration control

**How it works:**
1. Create a Custom HTML tag in GTM
2. Add your Sealmetrics tracking code
3. Set trigger to "All Pages" or customize by page type
4. Publish your container

Manage all your conversion tracking events directly in GTM without touching site code.

### WordPress Plugin

Native WordPress integration designed specifically for WordPress sites.

**Setup time:** 3 minutes

**Perfect for:**
- WordPress blogs and content sites
- WooCommerce stores
- Multi-site WordPress installations
- Non-technical users who prefer plugin installation

Install from the WordPress plugin directory or upload manually. Configure your tracking ID in the settings panel and you're tracking immediately.

## Framework-Specific Integration

### React Applications

Full support for Single Page Applications built with React.

**Features:**
- Automatic route change tracking
- Virtual page view detection
- Component-level event tracking
- State-based conversion tracking

**Implementation:**
Add the Sealmetrics script to your `index.html` or use dynamic script loading in your React app. Configure route change detection to track navigation in your SPA.

**Perfect for:**
- React SPAs
- Next.js applications

- Complex client-side routing

### Single Page Applications (SPAs)

Works with any SPA framework: Vue, Angular, Svelte, or custom JavaScript.

**Features:**
- Client-side routing detection
- Virtual page view tracking
- History API monitoring

Track navigation in modern web apps without page reloads. Sealmetrics automatically detects route changes and records them as page views.

### AJAX Form Tracking

Track form submissions that don't trigger page loads—perfect for modern web applications with async interactions.

**Use cases:**
- Newsletter signup forms
- Lead generation forms
- Contact forms
- Multi-step forms
- Chat widgets

Trigger custom events when AJAX forms submit successfully. Measure conversion rates without requiring thank-you pages.

Keep test traffic separate from real visitor data.

## Multi-Domain & Multi-Site

### Multiple Website Tracking
