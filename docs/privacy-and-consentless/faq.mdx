# Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ provides clear and concise answers to the most common questions about SealMetrics, how consentless analytics works, and how our measurement differs from traditional tools such as GA4.

---

## Why did you adjust 30% of Direct traffic in GA4?

Direct traffic in GA4 is currently heavily over-attributed.  
When a visitor accepts cookies **in the middle of their journey**, GA4 reassigns that traffic to **Direct** instead of the correct source (organic, paid, social, etc.).

This inflates Direct traffic and damages the accuracy of source attribution.  
SealMetrics does not suffer from this issue because it does not depend on cookies or consent.

---

## Why compare sessions (GA4) with clicks (SealMetrics)?

Because SealMetrics cannot track visits or sessions.

GA4 *groups* multiple visits from the same person into a single session.  
SealMetrics does not track individuals, so:

- If a user accesses your site 3 times within 30 minutes  
  **GA4 counts 1 session**  
  **SealMetrics counts 3 entrances (hits)**

Every return to the website must be treated as a new visit to respect ePrivacy and GDPR rules.  
This is why SealMetrics measures **hits/entrances**, not “visits”.

---

## How can you accurately track visitors if the data is not unique?

What do you mean by “non-unique data”?

SealMetrics tracks **every single hit** on your website with precision.  
We have been audited multiple times (technical and legal), and our methodology is validated.

If you want to test it yourself, open an account and watch real-time hits appear instantly.

There is no inflated data: we track exactly what happens.

---

## What about conversion attribution?

SealMetrics uses **Last-Click Attribution**.

Based on our legal analysis, it is the **only attribution model compatible** with privacy regulations **without requiring consent**.  
Multi-touch attribution requires individual tracking, which is not allowed without consent.

---

## Can you use the same data layer as GA4?

Yes, in most cases.

However, SealMetrics **must not** be blocked by Consent Mode or a cookie banner.  
SealMetrics must fire **always**, otherwise it stops being consentless measurement.

You can send values from your data layer (ecommerce values, custom variables, events, etc.) exactly as with GA4.

---

## Is campaign tracking impacted by consent requirements?

Yes, absolutely.

This is why many customers start using SealMetrics:  
they need to uncover the real ROAS of their campaigns without losing 50–85% of data due to cookie rejects.

Once they validate that SealMetrics shows the true business metrics, it becomes their **single source of truth**.

---

## How resistant is your solution to ITP and similar browser protections?

Currently, SealMetrics is not blocked by ITP or similar privacy protections.

In addition, we offer a **first-party tracking system**, which further increases reliability and ensures long-term measurement resilience.

---

## What extra value do you offer if a server-side tracking setup is already in place?

Even with server-side tracking:

According to **CNIL, AEPD, and other European DPAs**, you **still must ask for consent** if you are tracking individuals, even anonymously.

Server-side simply moves where data is processed  
—it does **not** remove the need for consent.

SealMetrics is different:  
we do not track individuals.  
That is why SealMetrics can operate **without requiring user consent**, and server-side cannot.

This means:

- No consent banners  
- No consent loss  
- No data gaps  
- Full visibility of your business reality
