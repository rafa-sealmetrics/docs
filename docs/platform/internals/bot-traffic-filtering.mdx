# Bot Traffic Filtering in Sealmetrics

Sealmetrics filters bot traffic using methods that remain fully compliant with GDPR, ePrivacy, and PECR.  
We never use IP addresses, fingerprints, or personal identifiers for bot detection.

Instead, we rely on a privacy-safe dual filtering system.

---

## Why We Don’t Use IP Filtering

IP filtering is no longer compliant with European privacy regulations:

- IP addresses are personal data  
- Filtering based on IP requires consent  
- Consentless analytics cannot rely on IP-based exclusion  

Sealmetrics avoids all personal-data-based methods.

## 1. Automatic Bot Detection

Sealmetrics automatically filters all traffic where the **user agent contains “bot”** (case-insensitive):

Examples:

- `Googlebot`
- `Bingbot`
- `AhrefsBot`
- `DuckDuckBot`

This removes the majority of known crawler traffic.

## 2. Behavioural Pattern Filtering

For bots that do *not* identify themselves, Sealmetrics applies behavior-based detection.

A user agent is temporarily blocked when:

**More than 4 clicks occur within 5 seconds**

If triggered:

- That user agent is frozen for **1 hour**  
- All hits from that agent are ignored during the freeze  
- This applies to *all* user agents (bot or non-bot name)  

This method:

- Avoids false positives  
- Protects analytics quality  
- Remains fully privacy-compliant  
- Detects aggressive scrapers, spam bots, and automated testing traffic  

---

## Why This Approach Works

Behavior-based filtering is more accurate and privacy-safe than IP filtering.

### Benefits:

- No personal data needed  
- Compliant with GDPR & ePrivacy  
- Detects real non-identified bots  
- Protects analytics integrity  
- Avoids blocking legitimate users based on network IP ranges

## Summary

Sealmetrics bot filtering is based on:

1. **User-agent bot exclusion**  
2. **Behavioural detection & temporary blocking**  

No IPs. No fingerprints. No personal data.

A modern, compliant, and highly accurate approach for keeping your analytics clean.
