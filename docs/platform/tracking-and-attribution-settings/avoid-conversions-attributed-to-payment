# How to Avoid Conversions Being Attributed to “Payment”

When a user makes a purchase and is redirected to a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, Redsys…), they temporarily leave your website.  
When they return to your **thank-you page**, SealMetrics may treat it as a **new session**.

If the payment domain is not excluded, the conversion is attributed to source: **payment**.

---

## What This Means

✔ The conversion **is tracked**  
❌ The original source (Google Ads, Facebook, Email…) **is lost**

For accurate marketing attribution, this must be corrected.

## Why SealMetrics Attributes “Payment” as a Source

Because SealMetrics is **privacy-first** and does not use cookies or fingerprinting.  
We only detect:
- Browser  
- OS  
- Screen size  
- Timestamp  

So when the user returns from a third-party payment domain:
- SealMetrics creates a new session  
- And assigns its domain as the referrer  

Unless you add it to your **referral bypass list**.

---

## When This Happens

Typical cases:
- Payment provider uses redirect flow  
- Thank-you page loads after a new session  
- Payment provider becomes the last referrer  

Example:
1. User clicks a Google Ads ad  
2. Adds items → proceeds to checkout  
3. Pays via `payments.xyz.com`  
4. Returns to your thank-you page  
5. SealMetrics detects referrer = payment domain → Conversion is attributed incorrectly

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: Add the Payment Domain to the Exclusion List

Add **only your payment provider domain**, not internal domains.

With this configuration, conversions retain the *real* traffic source.
